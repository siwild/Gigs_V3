JavaScript Functions:


showOptions function:

Triggered by clicking on the headers.

It's an asynchronous function (async) that performs tasks asynchronously, like fetching data from a file (JSON in this case).

It starts by fetching the JSON file using fetch('gigs.json'). This gets the data.

await response.json() converts the fetched data into a JavaScript object (data) that can be used in the code.

It finds all unique options available for the selected category by looping through the gigs in the data.

It creates an empty list (ul) to store the options.

For each unique option found, it creates a list item (li) and sets its text content to the option.

Finally, it appends these list items to the empty list and displays the list in the optionsContainer.


How it Works Overall:

When a category header is clicked, the showOptions function is triggered.
This function reads the JSON file and extracts unique options related to the clicked category (like genres, locations, venues, or dates) from the JSON data.
It then dynamically creates a list of these options and displays them in the webpage's optionsContainer.
So, when you click on "Genre," "Location," "Venue," or "Date," the code fetches the data, identifies unique options for the selected category, and displays these options in a list on the webpage.
